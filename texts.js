<p>  The global economic and social unrest beginning in the 1990s painted a picture of the corporation very different to that of the &lsquo;value holding and virtuous&rsquo; one under corporate culturalism. Not only did workers sense the falsity in the promise of autonomy within the limits of an uncompromising value structure, but a series of large scale corporate scandals, such as the oil wars, Wikileaks revelations, the growth of the anti-globalization movement and the fallouts of the 2008 global financial crisis made workers generally distrustful of corporations and their dubious doings. <sup>40</sup> Along with the withering trust of workers, the specter of &lsquo;there is no alternative&rsquo; emboldened corporations to steadily abandon the quest for public virtue, their corruption permitted because &lsquo;it&rsquo;s just the way things are.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Neoliberalism, as it frequently does, encounters here a crisis of confidence around the organization of work. Neoliberalism slouches on, however, exactly because through valorizing market mechanisms it is driven by notions of flexibility and dynamism, eschewing durable frameworks such that &ldquo;business organization is increasingly seen as a never conclusive, ongoing attempt &lsquo;to form an island of superior adaptability.&rsquo; &rdquo; <sup>41</sup> The logic of neoliberalism is to fight against the hostile world it creates. Although dynamic and expansive, this is not to say that control vanishes&ndash;instead with neoliberalism, &ldquo;capitalism is inventive and productive, and to capitalize, it progressively leaves the factory and invades, like a parasite, all spheres of life and the life-world itself. At the end, it ends up, as we shall see, producing and consuming life itself.&rdquo; <sup>42</sup></p>

<p>  There is major shift wherein corporations focus less on imposing or constructing behaviours, values and knowledge, but rather try to capture or enclose on that which the individual already has; namely the ability to self-organize, socialize and to utilize one's own experience to get things done. In order to exploit that which is out of late capitalism&rsquo;s reach, new forms of control need to be devised. In order to capture limitless potential, control needs to become limitless itself. Writing of the condition of this post-disciplinary society, Zygmunt Bauman notes that, &ldquo;Whatever else the present stage in the history of modernity is, it is also, perhaps above all, post- Panoptical.&rdquo; <sup>43</sup>    Gilles Deleuze was one of the first to apprehend what the implications of a post-disciplinary world was, one suffering a &ldquo;generalized crisis in relation to all the environments of enclosure.&rdquo; <sup>44</sup><br><br>  The new social forms, in contrast to the old and with the market as cardinal principle, is that production becomes &lsquo;meta-production,&rsquo; wherein &ldquo;What [capitalism] wants to sell is services and what it wants to buy is stocks.&rdquo; The longevity of the molehill is replaced by the skin shedding serpent. What this means is that, &ldquo;the postfordistic network organization is a &lsquo;lean&rsquo; organization; management, work(ers) and capital are decentralized, hierarchies are flattened, production processes [are] increasingly immaterial, products are no longer standardized but flexible, mobile, heterogeneous, differentiated, &lsquo;knowledge-intensive&rsquo; and orientated on &lsquo;niche-markets.&rsquo; &rdquo; <sup>45</sup>  </p>

<p>  In this &lsquo;network society&rsquo; modeled in the image of developing information technologies where power is dispersed to multiple nodes, one of the first casualties are boundaries. <sup>46</sup> The networked node nature of control makes it mobile. If &ldquo;exploitation is considered a practice of spatial and temporal confinement since control is the central motif of exploitation,&rdquo; then in societies of control where spatial confinements are increasingly blurred, exploitation and control become all pervasive. <sup>47</sup></p>

<p>  In 2004, Peter Fleming and Andre Spicer conducted a field study of a large call centre pseudonymised as &lsquo;Iocus,&rsquo; where social geography was reconfigured, and the line separating work from non-work was blurred. At Iocus, &ldquo;training workshops and everyday cultural messages constantly stress that all of those experiences employees wait until after work to have such as fun, partying, joy, fulfilment, exhilaration, friendship and even sexuality are appropriate to evoke in the workspace.&rdquo; <sup>48</sup><br> They observed the work and non-work boundary dissolving first, by the transfer of the outside to the inside: non-work rituals such as consumption, leisure and spiritual development were encouraged on the site of production. Secondly, by the export of the inside to the outside, with internal corporate cultures exported to life beyond work, an example being the frequenting of a pub on Fridays which although independent, eventually came to be governed by the firm&rsquo;s sexual harassment policy. </p>

<p>  Drawing from Gaston Bachelard, Fleming and Spicer contend that our sense of space is as much a feature of social imagination as it is the physical dimensions of the built environment. <sup>49</sup> At Iocus therefore, it is the case that &ldquo;Although there was little difference between the built environment and what we would typically find in &lsquo;industrial&rsquo; factories and office spaces, we observed a palpable difference in how workers experienced these spatial boundaries&#8230;the boundaries between work and non-work were blurred with little change to the built environment.&rdquo; <sup>50</sup><br><br> What Fleming and Spicer astutely point out is that transversing physical boundaries (between work and non-work) is instrumental in the often talked about psychological entanglement between life and work, wherein the two come to mean the same thing. Now, workers are asked to poetically endow or customise the workplace, to make it feel user designed and personal, in the hopes of invoking joy etc., unlike corporate culturalism which asked workers to find solidarity with the corporation&rsquo;s values.     <br>To be sure, the older methods of management do not completely disappear but rather contemporaneously exist with the new in a combination that is erratic and schizophrenic&ndash;itself an essential characteristic of the new. What has begun to predominate though, is the transformation of the built environment to complement and augment what has already settled in. Through physical movement around the often open-planned and &lsquo;station based&rsquo; workplace, Activity Based Workplaces (ABWs) hope to increase physical, mental and social health which in turn creates organizational health, heightened productivity and cost-minimization. <sup>51</sup><br><br> Expressed by the American office furniture brand Herman Miller in their &lsquo;Living Office&rsquo; product line: &ldquo;People are the most critical asset to every organization. So why aren&rsquo;t more offices designed to support their needs and activities?&rdquo;     More than simply being open-planned; comfortable and supposedly free-flowing &lsquo;organic&rsquo; movement is prioritized, with a range of facilities dedicated to specific activities as opposed to performing all tasks from the desk, all day. What's emphasized is that you deliver results, which allows one to work however and wherever they want&ndash; these workspaces provide a variety of settings, and the workday is sliced into different types of activities such as meetings, private concentration and collaborative ideation. <br><br>For an illustration, one might have a meeting in a cafelike commons for collaborative work, and then move to a sound-proofed pod for concentrated individual work, and then move again to informally sharing knowledge in a social kitchen. While the work itself might be continuous, this new spatio-temporal dimension punctuates the flow of productivity. Work feels less like a closed, uninterrupted period where it is performed, but a series of fragmented tasks completed in a given environment and celebrated as a minor victory before moving to the next; a series of finishing something without work ever ending.   <br><br>In Johannesburg, WeWork opened its doors for the first time this year&ndash; one in Rosebank, and another set to open in Sandton by December 2019. A tour of WeWork is enough to give a sense of its essential features (visited only a week after its official opening, it nevertheless bustled with life), although admittedly a more comprehensive empirical study is probably useful. WeWork in Rosebank occupies six floors of the Link, a stunning newly erected building housing offices at the doorstep of the Rosebank shopping complex, plus the Gautrain station (Africa&rsquo;s first highspeed underground rail transport). <br><br>Upon entering the ground floor comprised of black tiles, lighting and a water feature, the atmosphere is dark, cool and tranquil. Instructed to take an elevator to the sixth floor, the doors open to the WeWork reception and light powerfully floods in&ndash; a bit disorienting. The core of the building is hollowed out for the waiting area, the WeWork offices inhabiting the building&rsquo;s periphery behind transparent glass, all life within exposed. This liminal space flips the old Panopticon model. No longer a space associated with the fear of inspection by the big Other, it is instead injected with the warmth of welcoming and receiving a potential &lsquo;community member&rsquo;. <br><br>If the old Panopticon is a hellish prison-like fortress where you would hate to be behind the bars, WeWork at The Link is more like an ethereal heaven, where one longs for the other side, to be behind the glass &ndash; its seductive architecture and design deliberate.  Once inside&ndash;by no means an easy process, security is tight and access around the building regulated by a passport-like access card&ndash; you basically walk straight into a coffee bar, which doubles as a (another) reception desk. <br><br>While awaiting the tour guide, complimentary coffee is served (on this day by a deaf barista, an immediate grandstand to inclusivity and diversity of course, what Nancy Fraser calls &lsquo;progressive neoliberalism&rsquo;). The space is pimped out with fruit water dispensers, beer taps (for the time being serving ginger beer until an alcohol licence is obtained), table tennis, foosball&#8230; the works at WeWork! Indeed, the place is &ldquo;all about the vibe.&rdquo; <br><br>The membership tiers at different prices range from private offices, hot desks, dedicated desks and lab desks each giving different benefits and utilities, all with access to common shared spaces such as sound-proof pods, communal areas and the programmes and activations.   <br><br>The day of this tour was a &ldquo;Wellness Wednesday,&rdquo; where WeWorkers are treated to a complimentary healthy breakfast, a salad bar throughout the day, a stretching and mindfulness session in the morning and a yoga workshop in the evening. Tenants are offered discounted rates to the nearby gym, and for convenience sake, there are showers downstairs. <br><br>The Thursday after would have been a day experimenting with world cuisine (that week, Mexican Thursday) with a happy hour between four and five p.m. Following the weekend, members return to work, or given the 24/7 access, perhaps even staying at work until TGIM, &ldquo;Thank God It&rsquo;s Monday,&rdquo; WeWork&rsquo;s signature effort to kickstart the weekly rat-race with energy and enthusiasm by hosting motivational talks or treating members to a cultural performance (recently, acclaimed South African rapper Khuli Chana gave a silent concert, the audience tuned in via headphones).   <br><br>At WeWork, &ldquo;everything is taken care of, all you do is focus on your work.&rdquo; Members can even make WeWork their personal postal address and have parcels, bills and other goods delivered straight to them. <br><br>The WeWork community team focuses on creating &ldquo;the experience that you want&rdquo; through community, space and service. One of their &ldquo;social strategies to bring people together&rdquo; include their own social network with an internal currency system used for prebooking &ldquo;brainstorm rooms,&rdquo; as well as to connect with the WeWork community locally and globally, seeing details about other members&rsquo; business, projects and ambitions. <br><br>And to create a uniquely African version of the WeWork experience, &lsquo;African-styled&rsquo; artworks and design are dotted around the workplace. &ldquo;You feel at home in being at work,&rdquo; the tour guide casually remarks. WeWork is about &ldquo;finding balance within the space.&rdquo;   Amidst the crisis of neoliberalism and the accompanying disillusionment with work, leading many to view it simply as a means to a paycheck, WeWork provides an answer: to &ldquo;make a life, not just a living.&rdquo;</p>
