let blurred_text = "<p>Dreaming about your work is one thing, but dreaming inside the logic of your work is another. . . . [I]n the kind of dream I have been having the very movement of my mind is transformed: it has become that of my job. This is unnerving. &ndash;Rob Lucas The global economic and social unrest beginning in the 1990s painted a picture of the corporation very different to that of the &lsquo;value holding and virtuous&rsquo; one under corporate culturalism. Not only did workers sense the falsity in the promise of autonomy within the limits of an uncompromising value structure, but a series of large scale corporate scandals, such as the oil wars, Wikileaks revelations, the growth of the anti-globalization movement and the fallouts of the 2008 global financial crisis made workers generally distrustful of corporations and their dubious doings. Along with the withering t 40 rust of workers, the specter of &lsquo;there is no alternative&rsquo; emboldened corporations to steadily abandon the quest for public virtue, their corruption permitted because &lsquo;it&rsquo;s just the way things are.&rsquo; Neoliberalism, as it frequently does, encounters here a crisis of confidence around the organization of work. Neoliberalism slouches on, however, exactly because through valorizing market mechanisms it is driven by notions of flexibility and dynamism, eschewing durable frameworks such that &ldquo;business organization is increasingly seen as a never conclusive, ongoing attempt &lsquo;to form an island of superior adaptability.&rsquo; &rdquo;41 The logic of neoliberalism is to fight against the hostile world it creates. Although dynamic and expansive, this is not to say that control vanishes&ndash;instead with neoliberalism, &ldquo;capitalism is inventive and productive, and to capitalize, it progressively leaves the factory and invades, like a parasite, all spheres of life and the life-world itself. At the end, it ends up, as we shall see, producing and consuming life itself.&rdquo;42</p>"
